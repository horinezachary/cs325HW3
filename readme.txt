add all test cases to a file named shopping.txt, with the following format:
- T (number of test cases) (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) is given on the first line of the input file.
- Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer number N that indicates the number
of items (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) in that test case
- Followed by N lines, each containing two integers: P and W. The first integer (1 ≤ P ≤ 5000)
corresponds to the price of object and the second integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 100) corresponds to the
weight of object.
- The next line contains one integer (1 ≤ F ≤ 100) which is the number of people in that family.
- The next F lines contains the maximum weight (1 ≤ M ≤ 200) that can be carried by person i in the family (1 ≤ i ≤ F).

The output is written to a file named shopping.out
